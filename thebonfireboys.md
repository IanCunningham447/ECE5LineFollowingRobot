## Line Following Robot:
We designed our robot to face "wheels forward" allowing for more precise turning.

Riccardo customized the chassis of the robot to create a two-story structure that stacked the arduino on top of the potentiometer breadboard.

We wired the motor shield, potentiometers, motors, and photoresistors,testing all of them separately:
